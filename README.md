*Confirmed lab gear and technology you can play with*

- Eric Nielsen will have Raspebrry Pi and sensors handy  
- Expedient will allow people who sign up with access to their vCloud environment! And they will be in attendance to help people use it. **Send Ariel Sanchez a DM with 4 things - first name, last name, work email, company. They won't spam you, but it's needed for this generous gesture.**  This is great if you don't have a clear idea of what you want to build but know you will need some infrastructure.
- Ariel Sanchez will bring a 64gb NUC, Open vSwitch switch, and a VeloCloud device
- AdminWillie has a Pi with contollers.
