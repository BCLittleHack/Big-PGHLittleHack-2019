# Team SuperPi

Our goal was to compile and use OpenCV on a RockPro64, which is a SBC similar to a Raspberry Pi but much more powerful. However, the RockPro is not compatible with our existing camera, and no Linux drivers are available for the proprietary camera. Without a camera, the RockPro64 will not be suitable for our purposes. :(
